=============
ImageResolver
=============

A python clone of ImageResolver for finding significant images in HTML content
See the excellent JS version at: https://github.com/mauricesvay/ImageResolver

USAGE
-----

::

	import imageresolver
	import sys

	try:
		i = imageresolver.ImageResolver()
		i.register(imageresolver.FileExtensionResolver())
		i.register(imageresolver.PluginResolver())
		i.register(imageresolver.WebpageResolver(load_images=True, parser='lxml',blacklist='easylist.txt'))
		url = sys.argv[1]

		print i.resolve(url)
	except:
		print "An error occured"

Differences From the Javascript Version
---------------------------------------

* methods return instead of calling callbacks

* WebpageResolver has lots of new options (see below)

* Added some debugging features

* Exceptions are raised rather than callback to an error function

WebpageResolver Additions
-------------------------

* rules syntax is now based on AdBlockPlus filters (https://adblockplus.org/en/filters)

* New rules can be added without writing a resolver

* blacklist image sources and whitelist

* Loads as little of the image as possible when fetching for image info. Stops downloading if diminsions are found or a setable limit is reached.

* The original rules from the JS version are still implemented. (see options)

ImageResolver() METHODS
-----------------------

**__init__** *(\*\*kwargs)*

Keyword options

	* *max_read_size* - set to the maximum amount of bytes to read to find the width and height of an image. Default `10240`
	* *chunk_size* - set to the chunk size to read Default `1024`
	* *read_all* - set to read the entire image and then detect its info. Option will override max_read_size. Default `False`
	* *debug* - set to enable debugging output (logger="ImageResolver"). Default `False`

**fetch** *(string url)*

Fetches a URL and returns the response data.

**fetch_image_info** *(string url)*

Fetches an image url and examines the resulting image. Returns a tuple consisting of the detected file extension, the width and the height of the image.

**register** *(instance filter)*

Register a filter to examine an image with. The filter argument must be an instance of a class that has a `resolve()` method. `resolve()` must accept a string URL and must return a url or `None`

**resolve** *(string url)*

Loop through each registered filter until a url is resolved by one of them. If no url is found, returns `None`


FileExtensionResolver() METHODS
-------------------------------

**resolve** *(string url)*

Returns the url if the extention matches a possible image

PluginResolver() METHODS
---------------------------

**resolve** *(string url)*

Returns an Imgur image url if `url` matches the pattern of a plugin

WebpageResolver() METHODS
-------------------------

The work-horse of this module. Our uses revolve mostly around this filter and thus it is the
most feature complete and tested.

**__init__** *(\*\*kwargs)*

Initialize the class with options:

	* *load_image* - set to true to load the first 1k of images whose size is not set in HTML. Default `False`
	* *use_js_ruleset* - set to true to use the original rules from the Javascript version. Default `False`
	* *use_adblock_filters* - set to false to disable adblock filters. Default `True`
	* *parser* - set to a BeautifulSoup compatable parser (lxml is recommended). Default `html.parser`
	* *blacklist* - set to a file containing AdBlockPlus style filters used to lower an image's score. Default `blacklist.txt`
	* *whiltelist* - set to a file containing AdBlockPlus style filters used to raise an image's score. Default `whitelist.txt`
	* *significant_surface* - Amount of surface (width x height) of the image required to add additional scoring
	* *boost_jpeg* - add (int) boost score to JPEG files. Default `1`
	* *boost_gif* - add (int) boost score to GIF files. Default `0`
	* *boost_png* - add (int) boost score to PNG files. Default `0`
	* *skip_fetch_errors* - Skip exceptions raised by fetch_image_info(). Exceptions are logged and the image will be skipped. Default `True`

The default parser for BeautifulSoup is html.parser which is built-in to python. We *highly* recommend you install lxml and pass parser="lxml"
to WebpageResolver(). In our testing we found that it was much faster and more accurate. 

LOGGING
-------

Use the name "ImageResolver" to configure a logger. Skipped exceptions will be logged to this logger's error output and when enabled, debugging output as well.

EXCEPTIONS
----------

**ImageInfoException**

Raised if the image could not be read or type, width or height properties return undefined. 
By default this exception is skipped and logged but can be enabled with "skip_fetch_errors=False" option in WebpageResolver

**HTTPException**

Raised if the image could not be loaded from the URL. 
By default this exception is skipped and logged but can be enabled with "skip_fetch_errors=False" option in WebpageResolver

TODO
-----------------

Still missing the following resolvers:

* OpengraphResolver()


I have no plans to implement a 9gag resolver.

Need to implement better caching. Future plan is to include a configurable cache method so images seen across sessions can be cached for better performance
