	- fixed data files missing from the installed package

	- renamed example.py to resolveimg.py

v0.1.4, 2013-10-22 --
    - WARNING BROKEN RELEASE
	- fixed characters other than numbers w,h attributes causing crash
	- attempted fix an exception with some jpg files (broken release)
	
v0.1.5, 2013-10-22 --
	- Fixed indent error introduced in 0.1.4
	- fixed exception when processing some jpg files

v0.2.0, 2014-12-22 --
	- Some jpg images did not have enough data to properly set the width and
	  height of the image. This lead to exceptions. Now system continue tries
	  to read up to max_read_size bytes to find the proper width and height
	  info
	- Exceptions when loading images are caught and logged by default. Pass
	  skip_fetch_errors=False to WebpageResolver to raise exceptions
	- Added boost_ options to file types. Add (int) value to the score of
	  particular file extensions. These options add value to the score only when 
	  checking images directly. If a file is already blacklisted the 
	  additional score does not get added. The value can also be negative to
	  drop the score of certain files.
	- Changed significance logic. Surface calculation adds to score in
	  multiples of the significant_surface variable (now added as an option to
	  WebpageResolver)
	- Removed additional sorting by score. As images are processed the highest
	  score is held and that image is used. (performance)
	- Added options to global ImageResolver:
		- max_read_size: max number of bytes of an image to read (default
		  10240 or 10 K)
		- read_all: ignore max read size and load the entire image before
		  detecting properties
		- chunk_size: size of bytes to read at a time (default 1024)
		- debug: Enable debugging
		- boost_jpeg: Adds a scoring boost to JPG files (default 1)
		- boost_gif: Adds a scoring boost to GIF files (default 0)
		- boost_png: Adds a scoring boost to PNG files (default 0)
	- Added options to WebpageResolver
		- significant_surface: integer of the width and height multiplied
		  (e.g. 16 * 16) (default: 10000)
		- skip_fetch_errors: If True, skips and logs errors received while
		  fetching or reading image info. (default True)
	- Added a logger "ImageResolver"
	- Added __version__ to the module
	- Added command line options to resolveimg.py for debugging and
	  controlling the chunk sizes
	- Fixed some bugs
		- "data:" URLs caused an exception. Changed to ignore "data:" URLs as
		  they are unlikely to be significant images.
		- _score was called multiple times when it shouldn't have been
		- connections were not explicitly closed which caused performance
		  issues
		- Fixed URLs specified without protocol
	- Removed README.md and moved README.txt to README.rst.

v0.2.1, 2014-12-22 --
	- fixed an oopsy in setup.py and some other minor tweaks to docs
